#PROJECTS
1. D3-transitions
I used d3js to create sample animation. I call it colors of life. Which represents the start and end of journey of life with various transitions. 


2. mathGameForKids
The main theme of this game for to create a quiz for kids where they answer addition questions based on the difficulty level they select. They have 30 sec time to answer the quiz. They get the score once the game ends. The games ends when they either give an answer wrong on the time ends. 

The main idea was to use javascript to have dynamic display of text, play around with dom structure and to use external stylesheets.
